                <img src="assets/img/products/vape-pen.jpg" alt="APOLLON THC Vape" class="img-fluid">
                <p>The Apollon CBD Cartridge is a 500mg glass and stainless steel cartridge filled with wonderfully potent single origin, full plant, solvent free cannabis extract with the native terpenes reintroduced in post processing. There’s also zero pesticide or fungicide.</p>
                <p>The strain used was “Ringo’s Gift”. Ringo’s Gift is a high-CBD strain that crosses Harle-Tsu and ACDC, named for the late Lawrence Ringo, a cannabis activist. When they say it’s high in CBD, they mean it: 70% CBD and 5% THC, that’s a 14:1 ratio and on top of that RG has a terpene profile of 11%. The moment you vape it you can feel the pain and anxiety begin to be relieved. The taste is delicious too and you can definitely detect the terps as you exhale.</p>

                <img src="assets/img/products/cbd-thc-oral-spray.jpg" alt="APOLLON CBD & THC Oral Spray" class="img-fluid">
                <p>The 30ml pump-action bottle of Oral Spray contains 750mg of CBD in addition to THC, CBG, and CBC – each are powerful cannabinoids on their own but working together in the following formulation they operate on a level of healing and maintenance you’ll need to experience to believe. Each is listed below along with some of their greatest individual benefits.</p>
                <p>THC – Tetrahydrocannabinol 57mg. THC provides pain relief, eases nausea and vomiting, protects brain cells, aids with sleep. helps treat PTSD,
                increases appetite, is anti-inflammatory, and relaxes muscles.</p>
                <p>CBD – Cannabidiol 750mg. CBD benefits include acting as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antioxidant, antiemetic, anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent.</p>
                <p>CBG – Cannabigerol 11mg. CBG reduces intraocular pressure, and is an effective antibacterial agent.</p>
                <p>CBC – Cannabichromene 10mg. Blocks pain and inflammation, and inhibits the uptake of anandamide, allowing other cannabinoids to remain longer in the bloodstream.</p>

                <img src="assets/img/products/cbd-capsules.jpg" alt="APOLLON 12:1:1 CBD Capsules" class="img-fluid">
                <p>This bottle contained 10 capsules that were each 33mg so you have 330mg total. The cannabis used is Ringo’s Gift, a high-CBD strain that crosses Harle-Tsu and ACDC. It is named for the late Lawrence Ringo, a cannabis activist and CBD pioneer. The ratio is 12:1, CBD to THC, so the entourage effect happens synergistically making the cannabinoids work that much better together.</p>
                <p>The ingredients are simple and only include: full spectrum organic cannabis oil, pharmaceutical grade MCT oil, organic non-GMO soy lecithin, and the vegan capsule is just cellulose and gellan gum. This is real medicine and great for relieving a variety of ailments. Perfect to relieve severe pain and anxiety, aids in the treatment of epilepsy, seizures, autism, is anti-inflammatory, helps with insomnia, stress disorders, depression, lupus, arthritis, glaucoma, nausea and so much more.</p>
